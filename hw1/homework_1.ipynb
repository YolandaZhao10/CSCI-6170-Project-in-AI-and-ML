In this project, we use the **Weather Dataset (Rattle Package)**, which contains historical daily weather observations collected from multiple locations in Australia. Each record includes meteorological measurements such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind direction/speed, rainfall, and cloud coverage.\n",

        "The goal of this project is to solve a **binary classification** problem: predicting whether it will **rain tomorrow** (`RainTomorrow = Yes/No`) based on weather conditions observed today. To address this, we apply **logistic regression**, which is a suitable model because the prediction target is binary and logistic regression naturally outputs a probability value \\(P(y=1\\mid x)\\) through a sigmoid activation function applied to a linear combination of the input features. This probability can then be compared against a threshold to determine the predicted class. In addition to being computationally efficient, logistic regression also provides interpretable feature coefficients, allowing us to understand which weather factors are most strongly associated with rainfall on the following day.\n",
